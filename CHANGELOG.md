- MeshVisibilityCuller: fix incorrect tiling resulting in incorrect results.

### Changed
- ProjectionGenerator: Adjust the "onProgress" option callback to always take the "progress" number as the first argument.

### Added

### Added
- Ability to extract hidden edges in addition to visible edges.
- Optimizations to increase generation speed.
- Remove requirement to merge geometry ahead of time.
- A "MeshVisibilityCuller" class that can be run to help reduce the number of meshes that need to be processed.

### Removed

- PlanarIntersectionGenerator for generating model cross sections.

## [0.0.2] - 2023.09.30
### Added
- SilhouetteGenerator: performance improvements by skipping unnecessary triangles that are determined to already be in the shape.
- SilhouetteGenerator: Perform simplification of edges.
- SilhouetteGenerator: Add ability to see outline and mesh edges.

## [0.0.1] - 2023.09.18
### Fixed
- Some missing edges in projection

### Changed
- Largely simplified code
- Migrated logic from three-mesh-bvh

### Added
- ProjectionGenerator class for generating flattened, projected edges
- SilhouetteGenerator class for generating flattened, projected silhouette geometry (slow and sometimes unstable)
- Ability to generate intersection edges for projection with `ProjectionGenerator.includeIntersectionEdges`
